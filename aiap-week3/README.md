# Clustering algorithms
## This folder contains scripts to clean, engineer and process sales data to ultimately perform Association rules on customer segments.
### To get started with the project
1. Create a new by running `$ conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`
2. The run.py script will generate all the processed files as developed in Part 1 Notebook I.ipynb. 
3. The segmented customers can then be imported into Part 1 Notebook II.ipymb for association rules analysis. 
4. The raw data used is stored in the data/raw folder, and all intermediated and processed datasets are in the /data/processed folder
