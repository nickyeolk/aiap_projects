# Clustering algorithms
## This folder contains scripts to clean, engineer and process sales data to ultimately perform Association rules on customer segments.
### To get started with the project
1. The run.py script will generate all the processed files as developed in Part 1 Notebook I.ipynb. 
2. The segmented customers can then be imported into Part 1 Notebook II.ipymb for association rules analysis.
