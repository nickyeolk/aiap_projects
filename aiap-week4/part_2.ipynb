    "Before we go into deep learning modelling, we will first need to have a quick familiarisation with a deep learning framework. We recommend __[Keras](https://keras.io)__, which is built on top of Tensorflow, but alternatively, you can consider __[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)__. Resources are abundant online on how to use them, but here are some official guides to get you started:\n",
    "- PyTorch has a [60 Minute Blitz Guide](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/tensor_tutorial.html)\n",
    "- Tensorflow has an [Intro to Keras guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)\n",
    "\n",
    "A few words on the difference between Keras and PyTorch - Keras is a high level wrapper on top of Google's Tensorflow, the most popular deep learning framework out there. Being more low level, Tensorflow faces many issues and troubles, which are addressed by the abstractions of Keras, making it a great way to start. Facebook's PyTorch on the other hand is a newcomer which has received massive interest in recent years, and is playing catch up to Tensorflow/Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are more interested in how deep learning software has evolved since the days of Caffe and Theano as well as more in depth into what is happening in the software behind the scenes, we also recommend a [full lecture from Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SlgtELqOWc) on this topic, although this is extra knowledge that isn't fully critical to this week."

With the dataset you have prepared your machine learning model in the previous section, run your data through a MLP model with `Dense` (`Linear`) layers instead. Do some slight model adjustments, and discuss what kind of adjustments lead to improvements in score."
