# aiap_projects
Projects I worked on during the first few weeks of AIAP, implementing a bunch of algorithms by hand
Week1: Implemented decision trees using numpy
Week2: Boosting and ensembling
Week3: Unsupervised learning, visualized and tested various clustering algorithms
Week4: Implemented back-prop by hand, computer vision, CIFAR on Pytorch
Week5: Natural Language Processing: implemented RNNs, tested LSTMs on PyTorch
